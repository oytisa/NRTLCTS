# $\textcolor{Green}{\textsf{A Piloted Landscape Change Tracking System (LCTS) in the Bale Ecoregion (BER).}}$  
 

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the $\textcolor{Green}{\textsf{NRTLCTS}}$   interface to track landuse/landcover of Bale and West Arsi ecoregions of Ethiopia. It visualizes forest cover, the changes in landuse and forest. It allows users to explore the geographical distribution of stable forest areas, newly gained forest areas, forest areas that have been lost, and areas that have remained non-forest.
##
High-resolution, open, accurate, comparable, and timely land use maps are critical for decision-makers in many industry sectors and developing nations. These maps improve understanding of important topics such as food security, land use planning, surface water, and resource management planning. In addition, national government resource agencies use land use/land cover as a basis for understanding trends in the country's natural capital, which helps define land planning priorities and is the basis of budget allocations.

Land use and land cover maps provide a snapshot of an area at a specific moment, yet natural processes and human activities constantly reshape the landscape. Often, the availability of updated maps lags behind data collection by several years. However, our innovative deep learning approach with the Sentinel-2 10m Land Use/Land Cover Time Series enables us to generate a full year of observations within days. This capability allows us to deliver the most current analysis of land use over the past year and utilize the time series to identify changes swiftly.

The current versions of the applications were built on existing time series of updated annual maps of land use and land cover (LULC) with global 10m land cover from 2017-2023. The maps are derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution. Each map is a composite of LULC predictions for 9 classes throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of each year. This dataset was generated by Impact Observatory, who used billions of human-labeled pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model for land classification. The global map was produced by applying this model to the Sentinel-2 annual scene collections on the Planetary Computer. Each of the maps has an assessed average accuracy of 80%. These datasets produced by Impact Observatory and licensed by Esri were fetched from Impact Observatory. The original classes were then reattributed to forest, shrub, grass, settlement, cropland and other landuse.

For enhanced analysis of these changes, we have developed the Sentinel-2 a piloted landscape change tracking system in the Bale Ecoregion, which facilitates dynamic change analysis while exploring the map. The system was built on GEE.
Meet Earth Engine
Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. Scientists, researchers, and developers use Earth Engine to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface. Earth Engine is now available for commercial use, and remains free for academic and research use.

## The Landscape Change Tracking System User Manual thus consists three interlinked sub-applications of the system yet can be visualized independently viz:
```
 1.	Forest Cover explorer
 2.	Forest Cover Change Explorer
 3.	Landscape Change Explorer
```

The guide also includes instructions for selecting specific zones or districts/woredas and accessing summary statistics for those areas. Overall, this guide is useful for anyone interested in studying and understanding forest cover changes in the selected ecoregions of Bale and West Arsi areas.

# Forest Cover Explorer
This application provides a visualization of forest cover in Bale and Arsi landscapes. It displays the geographical distribution of forest areas and the respective forest cover by year in each landscape based on Sentinel-satellite images of 10m spatial resolution as produced by ESRI.
To open the Forest Cover Explorer, 
Navigate to [https://oytisa.users.earthengine.app/view/forestcover](url)
 Click **"Select Zone"**. 
 Click **"Bale"** for example in the dropdown list.

Now the application visualizes the forest cover in Bale. 
### Forest Cover Summary Statistics
It displays the geographical distribution of forest areas and the respective forest cover by year in the selected Bale ecoregion based on Sentinel-satellite images of 10m spatial resolution as produced by ESRI.

 Click on **"Select District"** to select the district/woreda of your interest. 

 ![image](https://github.com/oytisa/NRTLCTS/assets/25427373/81f07b03-5592-4913-b1d4-f251902d5b80)

Now it visualizes the extent of the selected woreda in white polygon, the corresponding forest cover and summary statistics as shown below.

Now let’s change the woreda of interest
 Click **"Mena"** to visualize forest cover of Mena woreda and cover statistics.

# Forest Cover Change
This application provides a visualization of the changes in selected ecoregions forest cover. It displays the geographical distribution of stable forest areas, newly gained forest areas, forest areas that have been lost, and areas that have remained non-forest.Based on the 2015 Ethiopia  new forest definition (MEF 2015) a forest is 'Land spanning more than 0.5 ha covered by trees (including bamboo) (with a minimum width of 20m or not more than two‐thirds of its length) attaining a height of more than 2m and a canopy cover of more than 20% or trees with the potential to reach these thresholds in situ in due course. The PROCESSES OF CHANGE DETECTION adopted followed the Ethiopian FRL types of land use changes; non-forest land use change to forest as gain, and forest land use change to the non-forest land use as loss.

 - Click **"Forest Cover Change"** or copy this link [https://oytisa.users.earthengine.app/view/ffnf](url) and paste to browser tab.
 - Click **"Select zone"**
 - Click **"West Arsi"**
 - Or Click **"Bale"**. 
 
 It will now compute the forest change for the selected ecoregion and display the map
 See the **Summary Statistics Chart** to the right. 
 In the figure below “Bale” ecoregion was selected showing its extent and districts represented with white polygons. The change shows the following categories
```
- Stable forest (FF)
- Lost forest (FNF)
- Gained forest (NFF)
- Stable non-forest (NFNF)

```
This is depicted in the graph as per the IPCC guidelines for biomass invetory in the AFOLU sector in the following nomenclature as shown in the consequent figure;
- **F->F** = Forest land remaining Forestland
- **F->NF** = forestland converted to Non-forest land
- **NF->F** = Non-forest land converted to forestland
- **NF->NF** = Non-forest land remaining Non-forest land
 The figure below shows forest cover convertions from 2017 to 2022 when Bale ecoregion is selected.
